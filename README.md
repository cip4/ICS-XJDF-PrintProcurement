# XJDF Automated Print Procurement ICS
This Interoperability Conformance Specification (ICS) document standardizes business transactions between a Print
Buyer and a Print Provider. In particular, this document defines a subset of the XJDF and PrintTalk specifications that has
relevance for automated print procurement. The price negotiation workflow that is defined by the RFQ and Quotation
Business Objects in PrintTalk is explicitly out of scope for this ICS.

This ICS document describes the workflow Business Objects required for submitting jobs from a Print Buyer to a Print Provider
and mechanisms for the Print Provider to either accept or refuse the job and to provide the Print Buyer with job status
information. Jobs can either be completely specified in detail for blind exchange or reference pre-negotiated product
configurations by identifier that have been synchronized offline.
